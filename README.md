# flutterDemo
Demo for student presentation on Flutter.io

- install Flutter.io via homebrew `brew install --cask flutter`
- then run `flutter doctor` to see if you need any other dependencies

To create a new project with web support
- run `flutter channel stable` to get the most stable version
- run `flutter upgrade` right after to upgrade installs to latest

- run `flutter devices` to see a chrome device that opens the chrome browser your app is running, and a web server providing the url

Creating a new app via Flutter automatically creates iOS, Android, and web versions of your app.

To create new app run `flutter create {your app name}`
then `cd {your app name}`

then to serve your app from localhost run `flutter run -d chrome`
